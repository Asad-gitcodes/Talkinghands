      <h2>Types of Hearing Loss</h2> <br> 
      <img src="/img/info-page-1.png" alt="Diagram of the outer, middle, and inner ear (parts of the ear involved in hearing)" style="max-width: 80%; border-radius: 12px; margin-bottom: 1rem;" />
      
      <p><strong>Conductive Hearing Loss:</strong> This occurs when sound is blocked from passing through the outer or middle ear. Common causes include earwax build-up, fluid from infections, or a punctured eardrum. It is often <strong>temporary or treatable</strong> with medication or surgery. 
      (<a href="https://www.cdc.gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CDC</a>)</p>
    
      <p><strong>Sensorineural Hearing Loss:</strong> This results from damage to the inner ear (cochlea) or the auditory nerve. It‚Äôs the most common type of <strong>permanent hearing loss</strong> and is usually caused by aging, loud noise exposure, or illness. While irreversible by medicine, hearing aids or cochlear implants can help. 
      (<a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hopkins Medicine</a>)</p>
    
      <p><strong>Mixed Hearing Loss:</strong> A combination of conductive and sensorineural loss. For example, a person may have both ear fluid and inner ear damage. Treating the conductive issue may improve hearing, but sensorineural damage often persists. 
      (<a href="https://www.cdc.gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CDC</a>)</p>
    
      <p><strong>Auditory Neuropathy Spectrum Disorder:</strong> A rare condition where the ear detects sound but the brain has trouble processing it properly.

      <!-- üëÇ Hearing Aids -->
      <h3>Hearing Aids</h3>
      <p><strong>Hearing aids</strong> are small electronic devices that amplify sound. Styles include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Behind-the-ear (BTE)</li>
        <li>Receiver-in-canal (RIC)</li>
        <li>In-the-ear (ITE)</li>
        <li>In-the-canal (ITC)</li>
        <li>Completely-in-canal (CIC)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Each style is suitable for different types and severities of hearing loss. For example, BTEs are powerful and used for children and severe loss, while ITCs are more discreet but suit only mild-to-moderate adult loss.</p>
      <p>Modern hearing aids include features like <strong>directional microphones, Bluetooth connectivity</strong>, and rechargeable batteries. Learn more at <a href="https://www.asha.org" target="_blank">asha.org</a> or <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org" target="_blank">mayoclinic.org</a>.</p>
    
      <!-- üß† Cochlear Implants -->
      <h3>Cochlear Implants</h3>
      <p>For individuals with profound hearing loss who do not benefit from hearing aids, <strong>cochlear implants (CIs)</strong> are an option. A CI bypasses damaged inner ear structures and sends sound directly to the auditory nerve.</p>
      <p>They consist of an internal implant and an external sound processor. CIs can help children as young as 12 months and adults with little hearing benefit from hearing aids. Learn more at <a href="https://www.cdc.gov" target="_blank">cdc.gov</a>.</p>
    
      <!-- üì≤ Assistive Devices -->
      <h3>Assistive Listening and Alerting Devices</h3>
      <p>Additional tools include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>FM/digital systems</li>
        <li>Induction loop systems</li>
        <li>Vibrating alarm clocks and flashing doorbells</li>
        <li>Apps that transcribe speech or notify users about sounds</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These devices help people in environments like classrooms, public spaces, or homes. Explore options at <a href="https://www.nidcd.nih.gov" target="_blank">nidcd.nih.gov</a>.</p>
    
      <p><strong>In summary:</strong> From hearing aids to cochlear implants and assistive devices, there are many effective tools depending on the severity of hearing loss. Consulting with an audiologist ensures a solution that fits lifestyle, comfort, and budget.</p>

      <h2>Communication Methods</h2>
    
      <!-- üì∏ Visual Context -->
      <img src="/img/card-page-5.webp" alt="Illustration of deaf challenges in work and school" style="max-width: 100%; border-radius: 12px; margin-bottom: 1rem;" />
    
      <!-- üåê Intro -->
      <p>Deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals communicate using a variety of methods depending on personal preferences and hearing ability. There's no single ‚Äúright‚Äù method‚Äîeffective communication is whatever allows people to express themselves and understand others. 
      (<a href="https://www.nationaldeafcenter.org" target="_blank">National Deaf Center</a>)</p>
    
      <!-- üßè Sign Language -->
      <h3>Sign Language</h3>
      <p><strong>Sign languages</strong> are rich, visual languages with their own grammar. For example:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>ASL</strong> ‚Äì Used in the U.S. and Canada</li>
        <li><strong>BSL</strong> ‚Äì Used in the UK</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Sign language is often the primary communication method for those who identify with Deaf culture. Sign language interpreters help bridge communication in schools, workplaces, and public events. (<a href="https://archive.ada.gov" target="_blank">ADA</a>)</p>
    
      <!-- üëÑ Lip Reading -->
      <h3>Lip Reading (Speechreading)</h3>
      <p>Some individuals use lip reading to follow speech by observing mouth movements, facial expressions, and body language. However, it has limitations‚Äîonly about 30% of spoken English is visible on the lips. It‚Äôs often used with other tools like hearing aids or context clues. 
      (<a href="https://www.hearingdogs.org.uk" target="_blank">hearingdogs.org.uk</a>)</p>
    
      <!-- üó£Ô∏è Spoken/Written Communication -->
      <h3>Spoken or Written Communication</h3>
      <p>Many deaf individuals communicate through spoken language, especially with hearing aids or cochlear implants. Writing and texting are also effective‚Äîpeople often use:
        <ul>
          <li>Texting apps and speech-to-text tools</li>
          <li>Real-time captioning (CART)</li>
          <li>Notepad apps for in-person interaction</li>
        </ul>
        Technology like video relay services, automated captions on Zoom, and real-time apps help improve accessibility.
      </p>
    
      <!-- üß† Multi-Modal Communication -->
      <h3>Mixing Methods and Assistive Tech</h3>
      <p>Many people combine methods: signing with friends, captioning in class, texting with strangers, etc. Visual tools and assistive tech (like FM systems and tactile signing) make communication more inclusive. The <a href="https://www.ada.gov" target="_blank">Americans with Disabilities Act</a> emphasizes the importance of providing reasonable accommodations for communication access.</p>
    
      <p><strong>In summary:</strong> Deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals adapt using a mix of strategies. With empathy, awareness, and accessible tools, both deaf and hearing people can communicate effectively.</p>

      <!-- üí¨ Daily Life -->
      <h3>Daily Life and Social Challenges</h3>
      <p>Despite advances in technology, deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals still face barriers in day-to-day interactions. Noisy environments, group conversations, or public announcements can be difficult to follow without assistive tools. As a result, social isolation and frustration are common.</p>
      <p>Stigma still exists‚Äîsome people assume deaf individuals lack intelligence or shout at them unnecessarily. A lack of accessibility (e.g., captioning or visual alerts) poses safety risks and limits inclusion.</p>

      <!-- üè´ Education -->
      <h3>Educational Barriers</h3>
      <p>Many deaf children struggle early on due to delayed language exposure. Parents may not introduce sign language early enough, and mainstream schools are often unprepared for deaf students‚Äô needs.</p>
      <p>Even with interpreters or captioning, deaf students face social isolation or fall behind academically. Only <strong>22.7% of deaf adults</strong> in the U.S. have a bachelor‚Äôs degree, compared to <strong>38.4% of hearing adults</strong>.</p>
      <p>Source: <a href="https://www.ndcs.org.uk" target="_blank">ndcs.org.uk</a></p>
    
      <!-- üíº Employment -->
      <h3>Workplace Discrimination</h3>
      <p>Employment is one of the most challenging areas. Many deaf individuals are underemployed or unemployed due to misconceptions about their ability and reluctance by employers to offer accommodations like interpreters.</p>
      <p>In 2019, only <strong>53% of deaf Americans</strong> were employed, compared to <strong>75% of hearing Americans</strong>. Even employed individuals often earn less and face exclusion from conversations, training, or promotions.</p>
      <p>Sources: <a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com" target="_blank">verywellhealth.com</a>, <a href="https://www.who.int" target="_blank">who.int</a></p>
    
      <!-- üí° Summary -->
      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>Deaf individuals often navigate a world designed for hearing people. With greater awareness, inclusive technologies, and supportive attitudes, many of these barriers can be reduced.</p>
      <p>Advocacy groups continue working toward a future with full access to communication, education, and employment opportunities for all.</p>

      <!-- üéØ How to Choose -->
      <h3>How to Choose a Hearing Aid</h3>
      <p>Choosing a hearing aid is a personal decision. Factors like your <strong>age</strong>, <strong>type and severity of hearing loss</strong>, and <strong>daily lifestyle</strong> play key roles. In the U.S., the <strong>FDA now allows over-the-counter hearing aids</strong> for adults with mild-to-moderate hearing loss.</p>
    
      <p>Behind-the-ear (BTE) models are usually best for children due to safety and adaptability, while completely-in-canal devices are more discreet and suitable for adults with mild loss.
